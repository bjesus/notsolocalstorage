# NotSoLocalStorage

Many great web applications relay on localStorage to save user data without requiring an account. This works wonderfully for user privacy, as no one has access to your data except yourself. However, it is also scary because it's easy to lose data if you reinstall your browser, and it's impossible to share the same data when connecting from different devices.

NotSoLocalStorage fixes that by allowing you to specify domains on which the localStorage will be synced to your Firefox Sync profile. This means that your localStorage lives encrypted with the rest of your browser settings and history, making it, well, not so local storage anymore.
